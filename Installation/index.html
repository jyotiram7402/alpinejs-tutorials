<!-- There is 2 ways to include Alpine js into your code-->

<!-- Way 1- From a script tag-->

<!-- 
<html>
    <head>
        ...
 
        <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>
    </head>
    ...
</html>

-->

<!-- Way 2- As a module-->

<!-- 

If you prefer the more robust approach, you can install Alpine via NPM and import it into a bundle.

Run the following command to install it.

            npm install alpinejs

Now import Alpine into your bundle and initialize it like so:

            import Alpine from 'alpinejs'
            
            window.Alpine = Alpine
            
            Alpine.start()
            
-->
